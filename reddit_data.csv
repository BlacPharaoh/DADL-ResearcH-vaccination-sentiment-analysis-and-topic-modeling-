So no, private, government, or healthcare employers aren't allowed to infringe on the medical rights of others as a condition of employment.Here are some quotes from the article which lay this out for you:""Judge Terry A. Doughty in the U.S. District Court Western District of Louisiana ruled in favor of a request from Republican Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry to block an emergency regulation issued Nov. 4 by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that required vaccines for nearly every full-time employee, part-time employee, volunteer, and contractor working at a wide range of healthcare facilities receiving Medicaid or Medicaid funding.""""Doughty argued in his ruling that the Biden administration does not have the constitutional authority to go around Congress by issuing such a mandate.""If the executive branch is allowed to usurp the power of the legislative branch to make laws, two of the three powers conferred by our Constitution would be in the same hands,"" he wrote. ""If human nature and history teach anything, it is that civil liberties face grave risks when governments proclaim indefinite states of emergency.""During a pandemic such as this one, it is even more important to safeguard the separation of powers set forth in our Constitution to avoid erosion of our liberties.""Doughty's ruling echoes one from U.S. District Judge Matthew Schelp, who issued a 32-page order on Monday blocking the Biden administration from enforcing their vaccine mandate on health care workers in 10 states.",1638619208.0

Once your personal choices start impacting the well-being of a population, there’s an issue. If anyone wants to choose to go unvaccinated, I’m perfectly okay with that in theory. In reality, their choice not to get vaccinated puts myself and others at risk, not just them. When talking about this, I think of the saying “Your right to swing your arm ends at my nose.” It’s simple, really. We should allow as many freedoms as possible so long as we don’t infringe on the rights of others. Using that logic, I don’t find mandatory* vaccines to be unjust in the slightest. If all the anti-vaxxers in the world wanted to form Anti-Vax island and live there in peace, I’d be perfectly cool with that, everyone knows what they’re signing up for. Unfortunately, they have to live in the real world with the rest of us, where most of us didn’t sign up for this shit. *How we define “mandatory” is relevant here. If by mandatory you mean required by the government or face arrest or fines, that’s a different topic (and a pretty far-fetched idea, imo.). When I use mandatory, I think of requiring vaccines in order to enter a grocery store or get on a plane or to enroll a child in school, and I’m okay with that.",1620932058.0

Or are you so disconnected from reality that you haven’t seen over the last 30 years there hasn’t been a single Republican president actually strengthen the economy they’ve simply taken credit for the decisions of democrats while gutting things once they get in office seemingly to ensure a collapse once they leave. Gutting workers rights, unions, stagnating wages, corruption, stifling innovation by bailing out archaic industries, and destroying the environment that is the legacy of the Republican Party.It’s astounding you can say they don’t try to punish the poor when programs that alleviate the burdens of poverty simply don’t exist under republicans instead they seem to simply wish for the poor to suffer instead. Republicans oppose pushing to raise wages, yet want people to work for pennies at minimum wage jobs that wouldn’t allow for you to ever live out of poverty why also refusing to tax businesses that frankly are giving their employees starvation wages.What legislation have republicans actually tried? Like at all the entire mantra of the party has been we do nothing and we’re all out of ideas because government doesn’t work. My entire life I’ve never actually seen the Republican leadership do a single god damn thing other than right legislation to repeal or undue actual legislation written by democrats.

Reducing safety regulations and artificially pumping up dying fossil fuel industries is not making the economy stronger. Reducing regulations and corporate taxes is not making the economy stronger is a pump and dump that doesn't add anything beyond temporary value. If it wasn't for covid is not a valid argument because guess what we have covid it happened if he and the republican party took things seriously and didn't fuel conspiracy theories we would likely be past truly pushing towards herd immunity but we aren't because people wont get the vaccine. Literally nobody is truly incentivized not to work. That simply is not a reality of society but it is 100% foolish to think people are willing to work for jobs that simply do not pay enough for people to live. You cannot live comfortably in Louisiana on minimum wage and Louisiana is one of the lowest cost of living states in the entire country. Raising minimum wage does not realistically correlate to a 1:1 increase in cost of product which is plainly demonstrated even when looking at other countries with a higher minimum wage or other states. Hell Colorado has a 12.50 minimum wage and the cost of good are not 5$ higher. Also that is absolute 100% dog shit that minimum wage is meant for people in highschool. Companies aren't having trouble attracting high school workers they're struggling to attract people to work weekdays in the middle of the day for minimum wage you know when high schoolers are in school. Guns are the stupidest fucking argument to make theres no point to the argument. I like my guns but lets be real they don't add a single god damn thing to society and every time a reasonable restriction on guns is shot down it only makes an intense one more and more inevitable.

998,Louisiana,"Really low vaccination rate in La. Meanwhile, in Costa Rica, people cross a turbulent river to save vaccines from a flood.",goldfinchcat,"Good question. A good case study to look at are the invasive rabbits in Australia. In 1950 people released myxoma infected rabbits which was so deadly it took out millions of rabbits. However in a few years a new strain (series of mutations) produced a more milder condition. Less rabbits died because this new strain did not kill the host as quickly or as frequently. In this sense the virus appear to have become less lethal. But why? Because the original strain was so deadly it killed off it's host rabbit before the host rabbit could infect another host thus it killed it's lineage. The new strains with the new mutations did not kill off it's host too quickly before spreading to another host. On the other side, the rabbits that were able to live had slight differences in their DNA allowing them to survive the myxoma infection. In the 1990s the myxoma virus had mutated the ability to reduce the immune system. Thus allowing other bacteria or virus to kill the host. Kind of like HIV. Today Australia still has a rabbit problem because there are rabbits that are able to resist the new myxoma strain. This case is an example of host-parasite arm race. (You can read this paper for more info on rabbits and australia -- Next Step in the ongoing arms race between myxoma virus and wild rabbits in Australia is a novel disease phoenotype by Peter J. Kerr, Isabella M Cattadori ... eta...)\---So how does this relate to Covid-19 and the human race? We are like the rabbits getting sick. Thankfully Covid-19 wasn't 90% fatal. Since Covid-19 has a long period of time to spread to it's next host before killing off the host those strains my not change. The Covid-19 lineage continues, sometimes you get a slightly different covid-19 strain (delta for example) and sometimes the old strain continues. Both are spreading just fine. Both can still kill their host in 4 weeks because the strains haven't killed off their lineage before infecting a new host. How does putting off the vaccine cause new mutations that may become worst for humans?  Time, more hosts to infect and grow viral population. There is nothing stopping Covid-19 from doing what myxoma did in rabbits like gain the ability to reduce the host's immune system. For humans, it's a race between our technology and an ever changing virus. \-- I hope I was able to answer your question.",1627688410.0

Child care..what if both parents are working? Even if they are working from home continuously stopping to help the kid with school work is probably exhausting. Some kids also just..aren’t showing up, or they are failing when they would typically be successful in a classroom environment. This is going to make it difficult for them to catch back up in the future. There’s also the negative impact of just being alone. Kids need to socialize with each other...the “weird homeschooled kid” is a stereotype for a reason. (I have nothing against homeschooling and know some very great people who were homeschooled, I’m just using it as a small example) spending a whole year alone when their little brains need extra stimulation/socialization is probably going to have negative long term impacts on them. None of these are more important that staying home to prevent the spread of the virus, but man we’re talking about children’s futures being altered.

1226,Louisiana,Louisiana's Solicitor General arguing against the vaccine mandate with the Supreme Court has tested positive for COVID-19,GandalfsAttorney,"Getting the vaccine drastically reduces your chances of having extreme symptoms and/or dying from covid. Everyone knows this by now. The vast majority of people who are dying are those who are unvaccinated, or who are vaccinated but still suffer from some kind of complicating factor (such as being elderly, having an auto-immune disease, etc.).  Ideally, if we have enough of the population vaccinated, it'll protect those who can't get vaccinated at all for health reasons from catching covid because there won't be enough host bodies for the virus to successfully replicate within and spread. There's also evidence that those who are vaccinated and still get covid have a lower viral load, are sick for a much shorter time period, and are therefore less likely to spread covid to others. I really wish people would stop acting like the vaccines don't matter ""because you can still catch covid if you're vaccinated!!!"" We all know vaccines significantly reduce your chance of dying from covid and reduce your chances of having severe illness. Hell the flu vaccine didn't stop me from getting the flu a few years ago, but being vaccinated made the illness a lot shorter and a LOT less severe than it was during years when I got the flu and wasn't vaccinated. The covid vaccine isn't foolproof, but it's definitely the best shot we have at getting this under control for good.

Don't tell me, because ""you are right and I am wrong"" as a school child would, or point another who does so.  ""Do this because we say and we say we are right"" But convince me with hard data and science.  Truth.  Illuminate me.  I am willing to listen, a scant rare thing on the internet.  If it is truth you truly bring. Show me the truth, that by no uncertain terms, that this injection or nasal spray is going to provide a sure, or as sure as statistical blind population studies can bring, health benefit while within an acceptable boundary of risk? Please, if this is the case I want to know! Because my research has been wanting.  “Vaccine efficacy studies on this new formulation of FluMist have not been completed, therefore it is unknown whether the vaccine offers any protection from influenza. The CDC voted against recommending FluMist over the available inactivated injectable influenza vaccines but stated it could be considered as an option, if appropriate.”“Since 2004, the seasonal influenza vaccine has failed to prevent influenza in vaccinated persons more than half the time, demonstrating a low of 10 percent effectiveness in 2004/2005 to a high of 60 percent effectiveness in 2010/2011. The average effectiveness of influenza vaccines over the past 14 flu seasons has been less than 41 percent.” If you have data, truth that is contradictory to this, some more recent information, please.  If not you, than somebody.  I want to know.  Because if it is true that the flu vaccine has turned a corner, I will protect my children at their next checkup.",1571422504.0

Covid mortality rate in the US, by comparison, is 1.1% as of 7/16/22 (source: https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality). That translates to every 1 in 100 people that catch it die. 3%-6% mortality rate means 1 in every 17 (6%) to 1 in every 34 (3%) people die.I usually visualize this by being in a room of people I know, estimating or counting the number of people in the room, then figuring out how many people in the room would die by applying the percentage.

2279,Louisiana,"After debate, LSU board asks Louisiana to require COVID vaccine for public school students",WizardMama,"Article:The LSU Board of Supervisors narrowly approved a resolution Friday asking the Louisiana Department of Health to add the COVID vaccines to the list of shots required before students can attend public schools, colleges, and universities.Supervisor Jay Blossman, of Mandeville, said he was uncomfortable with the university sending a message to the state that could lead to making students get vaccinated for COVID.“It gives me heartburn,” Blossman said, adding it should be a personal choice. “If you’re worried about the COVID, get the shot.”The Board’s resolution acknowledges the concerns raised by faculty and students, requests the health department to consider adding the COVID vaccines to the required list, and encourages voluntary vaccinations on LSU campuses.The Board’s Academic and Research Committee voted 4-3 to advance the resolution after much, and often, heated discussion. Then at the end of the hearing, the full board summarily approved all other matters advanced by committees during the Board’s meeting in Alexandria – except for the resolution. The board discussed the matter further, added language that LSU would also inform students of their legal rights to opt out of any vaccination, then approved the resolution on a 9-2 vote, with several supervisors not voting.Usually matters before the 16-member board that sets policies for the LSU colleges and universities are handled with unanimous consent and little conversation. The board, for instance, accepted the contract for incoming LSU president, William F. Tate IV, and outgoing LSU Health Shreveport Chancellor Dr. Ghali E. Ghali in a matter of minutes without much comment.State law already requires students to have been vaccinated against a lot of maladies such as polio, smallpox and diphtheria, before being allowed to attend. They can opt out for religious and medical reasons.But the COVID vaccines were only approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on an emergency basis and can’t unilaterally be added to the required list until fully approved, General Counsel Winston DeCuir told the board.In addition to state law, DeCuir pointed out that House Bill 498, which passed the Legislature and is sitting on the governor’s desk, prohibits discrimination against those seeking state services based on COVID vaccination status, and House Resolution 20 requires schools to inform parents and students that they can opt out of getting vaccinated for COVID.“So right now, the landscape is that there are laws to allow public schools to mandate vaccination but that requires approval by the Louisiana Department of Health,” he said.Attorney General Jeff Landry recently said he would likely sue the Board if the COVID vaccination were made mandatory at LSU.Faculty and student groups passed resolutions asking LSU leadership to require COVID vaccinations, as have been required as a condition of enrollment at many private schools around the country. Some states have allowed their public universities to require the shots, including Michigan, New Jersey, Massachusetts, California, Rhode Island, and Virginia, but none of the Deep South states have.LSU President Tom Galligan said 73% of LSU’s faculty have been vaccinated and 56% of the staff have. But only 26% of the students have received the shot.The LSU Board also formally accepted the employment contract of William Tate IV as LSU’s new president with applause and little discussion beyond outgoing President Tom Galligan saying, “Yay.’Tate’s five-year contract begins July 6. He’ll be paid $725,000 per year base salary, plus receive an annual $35,000 housing allowance, and a $15,000 per year vehicle allowance.With much less levity, the Board then approved Dr. Ghali E. Ghali stepping down as chancellor of the LSU medical school, returning to the faculty and being paid the remainder of his contract. His contract expires in December.",1624110679.0

I received a great education with the benefit of great English teachers who did teach me about the complexity of human life through authors lives and works and most importantly good science teachers that taught science. It was the few teachers who failed spectacularly at their subject, were particularly ill suited, under equipped, and in some cases had their own agenda that spoiled education for myself and so many others. I attended a Catholic school, and many of the falsities and binary thinking that I was exposed to there are the same beliefs and attitudes I have found in people working in and around the New Orleans area. In Carl Sagan’s book, The Demon Haunted World, the opening chapters discuss how the European dark ages perpetuated superstition over the acquisition of knowledge and that the previous generation condemns the next to the same ignorance. I feel like there’s a lot truth to his conclusions. Society will never rid itself completely of these problems but they can and should be mitigated.

I have the degree to diagnose it and have come to the conclusion that it is, in fact, pure lunacy.In all seriousness, I do think there’s a certain amount of what basically comes down to a kind of group hysteria happening here, that’s a mix of political and ideological extremism, an almost Stockholm Syndrome level of identification with the people actually waging and profiting off of mass class warfare against them, and systemic failures in the education and social safety net programs that should be supporting progress. And it’s clearly not just public schools. Private schools may (or may not) be turning out better scientists, but they are failing utterly at the basic humanities.Every safety net program we devalue, diminishes our value of human life and that quality of life. Every public health mandate flaunted, every abortion outlawed, every person “othered” by the privileged class HAS to be devalued in some way in people’s minds, in order that they may convince themselves that “it can’t happen to me.” This is where the “Fair World Fallacy” comes in.

It's about how people are so adamant that they refuse to consider anything to decrease gun violence. For example, take seat belts. Congress, or whoever, noticed a lot of people dying in car accidents and decided to create a group to study the issue and try to find a solution. And they came up with seat belts, which did lessen car accident deaths. But, every time guns are even mentioned, some people start spouting all types of vitriol, lying about how the Democrats or liberals want to take their guns, and threatening to do all types of stuff to avoid even the most basic study to figure out how to make guns safer or lessen gun violence. And that's ridiculous and the people who do this are incredibly ignorant to me. Nobody is wanting to take guns away. Sure, there may be certain types of guns they decide to stop selling to the general public (and just sell to the military), but noone is wanting to do away with guns completely. Will a study help decrease gun violence. I don't know, but I'm willing for them to give it a go. Because I'm tired of the mass shootings that happen here, especially the school ones.

They want us to be educated. Not just in the Bible, but with worldly knowledge (although, they made sure to warn us that all knowledge in the world isn't always good advice, which is just a fact). In the Bible, God wants us to take care of ourselves so we can have the capacity to take care of others. My point is, the loud minority gives the silent majority a bad image. It's not a prevailing trend throughout Christians, but the more boisterous of us tend to be the ones to cause the biggest detrement to the reputations of other evangelical churches. There is hope for Christianity, but the minority makes my job a lot harder as an evangelical to talk about God, because the second I say the words ""I'm a non-denominational/evangelical Christian"", people are already judging who I am based on what ""the majority of the Christian community"" are. The ones of us who are really into God's word, the ones of us who care for others and who want to make the world a better place, deny the teachings of big church. Deny the teachings of churches out of touch with scripture.

Your neighbor being fat as fuck won't make you fat as fuck.  You could get Covid and be fine, however the delta variant of Covid is highly contagious.  On average for the delta variant an infected individual will go on to infect 7 other people (for comparison the flu is 2 on average, while chicken pox is 10 and measles is around 18).  So essentially after just 3 rounds (6-8 weeks time) of spreading YOU will have been responsible for getting on average 343 other people infected.  With a death rate now around 1.5%, 5 people could be dead in the next two months because you didn't want to get a vaccine.The chance of you dying from just getting the vaccine is about 0.  The chance of Covid killing you after you've been fully vaccinated (2 weeks after 2nd shot) also drops from 1.5% to almost 0.This is just DYING.  If you don't die you still have a good (5% or higher) chance of needing to be hospitalized for 1-2 weeks.  Even if you have insurance, that's still going to be a costly bill, lost work/wages, etc...   Getting the vaccine lowers your chances of needing hospitalization by well over 100.  Think of the vaccine as not only giving your immune system a bunch of guns to fight off invaders, but also telling your immune system who the enemy is, so they can start shooting ASAP.   You might still get invaded, but it's much better for your immune system to be prepared for an attack, than to be caught off guard.   Do you have an alarm system for your house/car? Do you have a gun/weapon for your safety?   YOU can give your immune system both a gun and alarm system against Covid for FREE.  If the gun store was giving away free AR-15s and body armor to help fight foreign invaders you would have been in line to get yours yesterday.  Do the same for your own immune system, they like guns too.",1630696550.0

2498,Louisiana,So how many how young have to die Louisiana?,Ao_Andon,"The vaccines have all shown a profound and distinct ability to lessen one's chances of contracting the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which in turn makes one less likely to spread the virus to others, particularly if they themselves have been inoculated. While side effects do exist, the are generally mild or treatable. Alas, no vaccine is 100% effective, and so masks and other PPE (which are, generally, also not 100% effective on their own) are recommended in conjuction with the vaccines in order to help bolster one's overal degree of protection. While it *is* still possi le to contract the virus, despite precautions, studies have shown that such cases are typically shorter and less likely to result in death or morbidities, such as decreased respiratory function. To top it all off, the virus is evolving as it spreads, with multiple variations already found; not all of these, or future variants will be affected by the vaccines currently in production, necessitating whole new rounds of research, development, and testing for a disease that, by all accounts, could have been under control by now.These precautions are needed to prevent unnecessary suffering, both in oneself and others. Many people, like young children and the immunocompromised, are unable to receive the vaccine, and it is our duty as Americans and generally-decent-human-beings to protect them. Many hospitals are unable to admit new patients due to the influx caused by Covid19, or else crowd their patients together, spreading the virus along with other illnesses. Hurricane Ida also plays a role in this; having destroyed so many hospitals, the previously mentioned lack of hospital space is only being exacerbated.In short, get the vaccine to protect yourself, those you might infect, and those *they* might infect. The virus is potentially life-threatening, spreading, and constantly evolving, and due to the fact that diseases tend to spread in an exponential manner, your decision to vaccinate could help to protect untold numbers of people and relieve a medical system that's been strained to its breaking point.",1633185078.0

What's more, is that of those 346, only 4 were sick severely enough to require hospitalization, and **none** of them died. So please explain to me how the vaccines do not prevent infection, illness, or (especially) death, when one of the biggest antivax arguments has been ""why vaccinate when it only kills 1-2% of the infected,"" considering that at that rate, we should have seen 3-7 deaths. The only thing concerning to me at this point is that the infected vaccinated people *did unfortunately* show a viral load similar to that of unvaccinated infected,  which would suggest that transmission is still very much a possibility. Even then, though, between masks, vaccines, and the fact that vaccinated people have a much better prognosis when they *do* get infected, I have a feeling that most new infections will, unsurprisingly, be affecting the unvaccinated.

2673,Louisiana,Summary of Today's Press Conference with Gov. Edwards (6/3),WizardMama,"## Summary^(\*Information is typed live and may be paraphrased.)**Storm Incoming 2020 - Gov. Edwards*** TS Cristobal is headed for Louisiana.* We will receive rain before the storm so the ground will be saturated. This will be a severe weather event for Louisiana.* New Orleans and Baton Rouge currently slated to be on the East side of the storm. 10-15"" in 24 hours *after* several days of saturation from storms. Further west would be 8-10"" of rain.* Good news river levels are lower than last year when we had the hurricane, so there is more capacity for them to take in more water. There is no current threat to levee overtopping on the Mississippi River.**COVID-19 - Gov. Edwards*** Today has the lowest number of hospitalized patients since March 22nd.* 10.2% for all tests administered we want to get below 10%. We used to see 30-40%, but it hasn't been above 10% for 3 weeks and has been averaging closer to 5% lately.* With everything going on it is easy to feel overwhelmed. Louisiana has set up [conquercovid19.la](https://conquercovid19.la/) is a comprehensive website with resources and types to stay calm and reduce stress. For children, families, adults, and first responders. You can call 1-866-310-7977.**Billy ? of Tourism Board*** All welcome centers will be opened on Friday. Lobbies will be limited to 10 people at a time. Facilities will be cleaned multiple times per day and the staff will be wearing masks. Louisiana ""Feed Your Soul"" masks will be given out to all visitors.* Extending state park promotions (if you book 3 nights you get the 4th night free) with the code: WELCOME BACK* Louisiana's over the past several weeks have supported museums and state parks. The last two weekends saw over 10,000 visitors to the state parks. That hasn't happened since 2008. Everything was done with safety in mind.* Asking Louisiana to support Louisiana! Take a staycation or road trip around our great state!* Offering Louisiana seafood prepared by a Louisiana Chef and Louisiana musicians to conferences.* Just landed a national trucking conference to St Charles that was going to go to Miami.**Questions:***In terms of conventions and conferences, what are the requirements for them?*Most conferences are slated for the end of the year or next year. The trucking conference is next year. Many of the smaller conferences are for the end of the year when we are hopeful we will be through the 3 phases and back to normal.*Which state park had the largest turn out recently*?Grand Isle. Louisiana had a great response to that special and booked every cabin and location available.*Will there be an effect on the budget?*Yes, absolutely but RV sales are up significantly and we are pushing people to travel to state parks and eat in the local communities. We see this as a trend for next year and will take advantage of it.*Are there other conventions that are looking to leave Louisiana?*Yes, we are currently working with 9 other conferences, but do not want to release the name. The trucking company polled its members and with the Louisiana seafood and entertainment, they wanted to come to us. We will do everything to have our calendar full for next year.*With everything going on can Louisiana handle everything going on?*Yes, we can because we are tough people. There is not a hurricane in the Gulf and there are no forecasts staying it will be a hurricane at landfall, although it could theoretically pick up speed and be a Cat 1 at landfall. I have asked local religious leaders to pray for us. \[List of all issues Louisiana is facing\], you just start adding it all together and then you get to the illegal killing of George Floyd... \[thanks people of Louisiana for peaceful protests\]. You do have all of that going on and now you have the Tropical Storm Cristobal and the heavy incoming rains but the people of Louisana are very tough resilient people, its not that I don't worry, I do. I'm just always amazed at how hard-working, good, and faithful our people are. We are working with every region, and aid available to the state. We've been working with FEMA since the start of the public health event to prepare for storm season with the pandemic.*Is there a chance of an evacuation being ordered?*Right now I am not announcing an evacuation. The national weather service told us today that Saturday night is the earliest it will hit but will most likely be Sunday. What we know is that it will dump a lot of rain and has the possibility of stalling. We are encouraging everyone to take this very seriously and be as ready as you can be for it. We know the rivers are a few feet lower than what they were when the Hurricane hit last year. We know they have more capacity for rainfall.*In terms of sheltering if that is needed what plans have been made in light of COVID-19?*We have plans that involve mega shelters as an option and have prepositioned tents so people can have a semi-self contained area. Congregant shelters are not optimal. Many weeks ago we began working on getting early approval for sheltering in hotels or motels rooms. Another challenge we have is the Red Cross volunteers will not be available to us as they normally are because they are in the vulnerable age group. Historically we have had reciprocal agreements with sister states where if we need to evacuate a large portion of our population other states will take us in. This is complicated by the national health emergency, and we are trying to work it.As for this weekend, we are not announcing any evacuations or shelters but will announce them if it becomes necessary.*Monday you mentioned you were working with the Federal Gov on the protests? What type of information are they providing?*The information we have been getting has been very generic in nature. Things they are seeing in other states and what we should prepare for.In regards to t*ourism is there any fear that it may be hard to persuade people to come back here as opposed to other states that weren't hit as hard as COVID-19.*Due to Louisiana's uniqueness in America, we will get back to where were before COVID-19. We are not sure when that will be, but you can remember in the immediate aftermath of Katrina people were saying New Orleans and Louisiana will never come back. Our people are much more resilient than that and our state is so unique. This will be predicated on things we cannot control like when the vaccine will be released and when the virus will be less of a menace.*Does the state plan to extend eviction deadlines?*We are working on that. We suspended evictions but not the requirement to pay rent. We encourage all individuals to work with their landlords to come up with a payment plan to catch up on missed rental payments. We are working with various organizations to see if there is funding available for a rental assistance program. I do have a formal announcement for this moment but it is something we are looking at. CARES Act money is largely spoken for. We are looking at legislation moving through Congress to see if those funds could be used.^((This was post has originally appeared LIVE on) r/Coronaviruslouisiana^(.))",1591215144.0

2678,Louisiana,Summary of Today's Press Conference by Gov. Edwards,WizardMama,"# Moving into Phase 2 on Friday, June 5th.**SUMMARY**^(\*Note everything is written down live and to keep up must sometimes be paraphrased by me.)*Gov. Edwards** 1 st day of hurricane season Invest-93L 90% chance of development* Ranked 10th at State with highest coronavirus cases per capita, we used to be number 2.. so good job!!!* Today is the lowest amount of deaths reported since March 22nd.* The lowest amount of hospitalized patients since March 25th.* Louisiana did exceed the testing goal for May and exceeded 200,00 tests for the month well in excess of 4.3% of the population. In May we doubled the tests we did in April. The CDC goal is 2% and we are more than twice that!* We are getting close to a 10% total case positivity rate.* Louisiana is seeing signs of progress and heading in the right direction, but there is still a lot of COVID-19 in the state. It is in every community. We are ramping up testing and contact tracing.* Not every region of the state is doing well.*The great Doctor Billioux** The state is seeing a decreasing amount of peoples showing up to emergency departments with COVID or flu-like symptoms.* Cases are continuing to decrease.* Hospitalizations are continually decreasing.* This progress IS NOT EVEN ACROSS THE STATE.   * Region 6 is increasing in cases and hospitalizations (Rapides) with congregate setting spread AND community spread.   * Region 1,5, and 9 are in Plateauing in cases.* Always looking at percent positivity rates.   * Yes even as we are finding more cases, as a portion of cases to total tests (case positivity rate) that is still coming down.* While the state is seeing a reduced amount of hospitalizations in the state. Region 8 is seeing an increase as well as Region 6.* 613 contact tracers have been hired and 303 have completed their training.   * 219 cases/contacts have been referred to resource coordinators.* Upon a positive result, we are trying to reach out to possible contacts within 24 hours and possibly infected people out of the public.* If you are exposed you will receive a phone call from \[NUMBER TO BE ADDED LATER\].* Data is promising so it is reasonable to move into Phase 2 as these trends move forward.* **Largest difference(s) between Phase 1 & 2:**   * Up to 50% occupancy with parties maintaining 6ft of distance in previously approved open businesses.   * Bars and breweries without LDH food permits can open at 25% occupancy seated.   * Day spa, tattoo-shops, massage shops, and estheticians can open.   * Swimming pools (controlled recreational swimming) can open.   * Bowling, skating, and event centers can open.   * Individuals who are 65+, cardiac disease, diabetes, lung disease, obesity, or immune disorders are still in Phase 0 and stat home if at all possible. There is still a lot of COVID-19 in our communities. Even if you are not in a high-risk group you need to evaluate if you live with someone high-risk or around someone who is high-risk.* **YOU STILL NEED TO WEAR A MASK** wearing a mask may last up to 3 years! The main mode of transmission is by particles that leave our mouths by speaking, singing, yelling, sneezing, coughing, etc.   * If you see no one is wearing masks and are not following guidance do your job as a consumer and do not patronize that business. Do not put your life at risk for something like a bowling game.* Continue to stay at home when you are sick, wash your hands often for 20 seconds at a time, and practice social distancing (stay 6ft away) from people who are not part of your household.*Why were assisted living facilities not included in the nursing home statistics?*When we think of congregate settings we worry about the spread in that setting. We know there are high levels of asymptomatic carriers. That presents a real risk where you live in close contact and cannot keep yourself separate.Nursing homes present a unique risk for bad outcomes for people who live there because they are more likely to be 65+ and/or have the high-risk comorbidities.*What about visiting nursing homes*?They have the highest risk, we do not know what late summer early fall will bring with new treatments, plenty of PPE, or possible vaccines. You need to balance the risk of COVID spread with the risk of loneliness. For the elderly the risk of loneliness can be deadly.*Rationality on restrictions on bars why are they restricted more than restaurants?*It is an evolving epidemic and we learn more after time. Bars are a very high risk for facilitating a high spread of COVID-19. We have seen in other locations that bars have had to be shut down due to the bars causing too many outbreaks. We would rather open in a slow steady safe manner than have to snap back restrictions. For bars, the customers will have to be seated to served and seated 6ft apart. We hope that we will be able to reduce the high risk that bars present for transmitting COVID-19.*Gov. Edwards** Children's museums are not closed in Phase 2 but have certain restrictions they must follow like closing down every set period to cleanse and disinfect. Certain tactile exhibits may be limited.* **Phase 2 will last 21 days and will expire on June 26th.*** Everyone needs to take personal responsibility and people should not patronize establishments that do not follow guidelines.* The greatest risk of the virus is with airborne transmission.   * With more businesses open and more customers go back in contact will increase so it more important than ever that people wear masks when not dealing with people in their household.* LDH has a ""thank you for wearing a mask"" signs for businesses to print and display. More specific guidelines will be provided at [opensafely.la.gov](https://opensafely.la.gov/)**In regards to the protest*** Our protests have been peaceful.* Thanks Faith Leaders who have been in good communication with the state and the public at large.* Thanks everyone for keeping the focus on issues of concern. Obviously what was captured on video that happened to George Floyd was egregious and far below what is acceptable. No member of society or law enforcement will agree that those actions were acceptable.* We had similar issues in 2016 but have reformed our criminal justice system and how law enforcement is trained and interacts with the public. We continue to try and grow.* Will continue to work with local and state agencies to monitor and keep in front of developments.*Questions*Do you agree with the President and believe all Governors are weak?I am not going to engage in that. I was in the call. I believe the President was addressing other leaders.*Is it time to revisit some of the state's policies with the criminal justice system?*I suspect this could be better addressed to a law enforcement official. I do not believe any training promotes the type of actions that the officer displayed. It is a gross departure with what is part of the police training. We need to do a better job with hiring, training, and monitoring over-time to ensure that officers should still be employed.*Opening schools*We will know more as we receive additional guidance from the CDC.*Sleepaway & summer camps*Sleepaway camps will not be allowed. Summer camps have been allowed since Phase 1 with 1 adult and no more than 9 children in a camping group. Will change to 1 adult per 24 children.*People wrote a letter in opposition to not these guidelines*We are following all White House and CDC guidelines.*What about the* *W.H.O. initial advice against wearing masks*The CDC of. the United States and the Office of Public Health in Louisiana all agree on the use of masks. As we find out more about the airborne transmission of this virus coupled with the asymptomatic carriers it just makes sense. Guidance has been clear and consistent for many weeks now.

2680,Louisiana,Summary of Today's Press Conference by Gov. Edwards,Tiger00012,"Honestly, I got out to buy ground coffee yesterday at a local coffee shop and it felt like we've already moved on with this phasing thing. No one was wearing any masks, it just felt like usual, all the people around, going to restaurants nearby, enjoying their lives",1591045518.0
2681,Louisiana,Summary of Today's Press Conference by Gov. Edwards,,Thanks for this.  Comes in handy for those of us who are working and cannot watch the whole thing.You're the TL;DW (watch) master!,1591045033.0
2682,Louisiana,Summary of Today's Press Conference by Gov. Edwards,Blucrunch,"> If you see no one is wearing masks and are not following guidance do your job as a consumer and do not patronize that business. Do not put your life at risk for something like a bowling game.This is actually a tough one. The thing is, larger organizations, from what I can tell, are more likely to be following all the guidelines well (with exceptions!) than local, smaller organizations. Why this is I can only speculate, but I'd venture to guess that having a larger amount of resources means they're more informed and prepared and have the infrastructure and personnel to implement the guidelines.We don't, however, want to stop patronizing local places in favor of large organizations. So, what do?The best thing an overachiever could do is if you patronize a local business that you like, and then notice wearing masks not being enforced, or worse, openly flouting those guidelines, call up that business and speak to a manager. Ask what guidelines they are following. Explain that you think they are important guidelines to follow. Explain also that if they won't consider following these guidelines more closely that you will be going to their direct competition (find out what that is and name drop, for more impact). If they refuse or you witness no change, stop going there and follow through with your threat.That's a lot, I know. I'm open to other suggestions we can follow in order to promote safety as the pandemic winds down.",1591048364.0
2683,Louisiana,Summary of Today's Press Conference by Gov. Edwards,WizardMama,I think your suggestions are spot on. These are added expenses to running a businesses that has been generating possibly little to profit for the past few months. No one should jump the conclusion that business owners aren’t complying due to a political or societal stance.,1591048506.0
2684,Louisiana,PSA Regarding COVID-19: Warning,ilikelegoandcrackers,"[NEW: As requested, a [downloadable PDF](https://docdro.id/30e3nnc) version of this document is now available to send to relatives]If you just want to learn how to reduce your risk of catching COVID-19, scroll down to the ""Risk Reduction"" section. However, to appreciate the full scope of the challenge ahead, you are encouraged to carefully read this entire document, which will be updated regularly as long as it stays on the front page of your sub.The aim of this document is simple: it's best to walk into something knowing what you're about to face. It also aims to reduce anxiety, panic, and misinformation by arming you with key sourced information, all without downplaying the risks of COVID-19.The document has gone through hundreds of iterations thanks to global community feedback, including from places such as Seattle, LA, Australia, and Canada. Although all facts are meticulously sourced from experts in their fields, you are responsible for your own health and your own research. Further, contextualization of information remains an ongoing challenge, as does keeping up with a fluid situation. Final word will always belong to the health authorities, as well as the mods of this subreddit.Now brace yourself, because this is going to suck a little bit.#**CONTEXT:**A recent in-depth [study](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2002/2002.03268.pdf) has shown just how incredibly infectious COVID-19 is. Unfortunately, its spread [has not slowed](https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fe4uza/how_would_you_visualize_the_evolution_of/), and the virus has only been halted through stringent physical distancing measures.In other words, and as the Director of the WHO himself has [said](https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1235635005415739393), this is not a drill.**The bad news:** There are currently over [300,000](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) global confirmed cases of COVID-19, and the WHO recently [classified it](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1237777021742338049) as a pandemic. Now it seems that it has arrived upon your doorstep, which means there is likely exponential and silent human-to-human transmission in the community.**The good news:** knowledge is a weapon that defeats these things. It worked in 1918 against the Spanish Flu, when we essentially stopped the medieval practice of blood-letting (you know when they drained you of blood because they thought that would cure whatever ailed you? Or leeching?). And it worked against many other outbreaks since: Smallpox, MERS, SARS, Ebola, etc. The WHO's tackling of Smallpox alone was nothing short of scientific heroism.And so, a hundred years after 1918, here we are again, facing perhaps the [greatest test of our generation](https://twitter.com/Channel4News/status/1235994748005085186).The problem is that these days we're inundated with so much information that, when a real threat comes along, it's buried under a mountain of clutter. And although this document is not all-encompasing by any means, hopefully it will help you see through some of that clutter, as well as give those new to the threat an opportunity to hit the ground running.So go ahead and meet [your foe](https://i.imgur.com/okCsxd1.jpg). Do not underestimate it. Now prepare to go to war.#**IMPORTANT:*** **The main mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets: coughing, sneezing, and breathing.** But you can also get it through shaking hands, kissing somebody who is sick, or touching a contaminated surface (droplet dispersion; think of a cough plume settling). This can include handrails, doorknobs, elevator buttons, and surfaces prone to a droplet dispersion cloud. ""Cough dispersion"" basically means anytime a sick person coughs, they're dispering a plume of droplets over a given area. The viral particles within those droplets then settle on ordinary surfaces. People touch those surfaces then touch their phones or their faces, which in turn lead to contact with their eyes, mouth, or nose, inducing infection. Therefore it is best to keep a 6 ft ""coughing distance"" from people, and treat everything you touch in public as if it's been contaminated (see the ""Risk Reduction"" section below). **[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bI5pQGXl2o&feature=youtu.be) an excellent short video on the topic.** Read a little more on the subject [here](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek).* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW, BUT IS GAINING [ACCEPTANCE](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/health/coronavirus-how-it-spreads.html?0p19G=2870) IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY]** There now appears to be evidence the virus can spread through breathing. Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota: **""The findings [of the study] confirm that COVID-19 is spread simply through breathing, even without coughing. Don't forget about hand washing, but at the same time we've got to get people to understand that if you don't want to get infected, you can't be in crowds. Social distancing is the most effective tool we have right now.""** [Source.](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/03/study-highlights-ease-spread-covid-19-viruses) (Crucial to understand: the research specifies patients who are symptomatic, and makes no claims about asymptomatic transfer.) **UPDATE:** [Dr. Osterholm just went on the Joe Rogan show to explain the situation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3URhJx0NSw). Although the show itself has been known to be controversial, the Doctor's [credentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Osterholm) speak for themselves.* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW]** A new study indicates COVID-19 can survive in the air for up to 3 hours, and several days on surfaces, depending on the surface (up to 3 days on plastic, up to 2 days on metal, up to 1 day on cardboard).

Unfortunately it is a bit misleading as it does not show drop dispersion, but gets the point across.* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW]** New analysis seems to indicate infected people without symptoms might be driving the spread of coronavirus more than we realized (CNN [link](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/14/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-spread/index.html), with links to multiple studies in the article). This is corroborated by Dr. Norman Swan on March 14th, via ABC Australia, who says ""you *are* infectious *before* the symptoms come out, there's no question about that."" The WHO says you are infectious for about 48 hours prior to showing first symptoms. (Source 1: Dr. Swan: see minute mark 4:02 in [this health alert video](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-15/dr-norman-swan-recommends-proactive-national-lockdown/12057956)), ([Source 2](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms)). **ALERT: It is now generally believed that this is the reason the virus is taking so many communities by surprise: it spreads during that crucial asymptomatic/low-symptom stage.** * **WARNING:** March 16th Article, based on fresh research: ""80% of COVID-19 spreads from people who don't know they are sick"" ( [Article](https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2020/03/16/80-of-COVID-19-spreads-from-people-who-dont-know-they-are-sick/7771584372104/?ds=5) | [Study](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/03/13/science.abb3221) | [Discussion 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fjntyc/substantial_undocumented_infection_facilitates/) | [Discussion 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fjre8d/80_of_covid19_spreads_from_people_who_dont_know/) )* **WARNING: We are past containment.

But this is an oversimplification as the metric skews toward the elderly and those with comorbidities (see the Mortality/Comorbidities section below). Plus the metrics differ based on [region and testing capacity](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/10/simple-math-alarming-answers-covid-19/). [Excellent short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOJqHPfG7pA&feature=youtu.be) on the topic.* Here's a breakdown of the above: Approximately 80% of laboratory confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, which includes non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases. 13.8% have had severe disease requiring hospitalization, and 6.1% were critical, requiring the ICU (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure). (These numbers are as of Feb 20, 2020, based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases in China, from the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf).) **Update:** European Society of Intensive Care Medicine is reporting a 10% ICU rate, and has [issued a word of warning](https://twitter.com/marcelsalathe/status/1235662457261023232).* Due to the highly infectious nature of COVID-19, **the danger is not just the mortality rate for the vulnerable, but the possibility of overwhelming the health infrastructure, which in turn causes unnecessary fatalities.** * As it stands, it wouldn't take much to overwhelm hospitals, hence why it's important to start taking preventative measures now (outlined in the Risk Reduction section below)—especially because hospitals are already burdened with a heavy flu season (in the Northern hemisphere, that is). For example, if only 10 out of every 1000 people required a bed, we'd already be coming up short, as in the USA there are only [2.77](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds for every 1000 people, and [2.58](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) in Canada. Why is this important? **In South Korea, 4 in 22 deaths happened while waiting to be hospitalized** ([source](https://n.news.naver.com/article/005/0001294063) in Korean, as well as a [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbxm0s/south_korea_4_in_22_deaths_happened_while_waiting/) about it), and that's from South Korea, who is #2 in the world bedcount-wise with [12.27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds per 1000 people. And of course many beds will already be occupied for regular patients.

Do not underestimate this virus.#**PSYCHOLOGY:*** Do not panic, but give yourself permission to feel fear. [Fear gets you prepared](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm). As for panic, all one has to do is look at the crowded halls of Wuhan hospitals during the early phases of the outbreak to understand how panic worsens problems. A jolt of fear is all right, as it gets you moving in the right direction. After that point, however, you must turn to thinking clearly, level-headedly, and listen to your local health authorities. As for what you can do, follow the steps in the ""Risk Reduction"" section below.* Ignoring this threat will only make it worse, as it preys on your underestimation of it. That underestimation may cost you your life, or the life of a loved one.* Upon first learning about the extent of the threat, you may become anxious and hyper aware and start taking extra pecautions. This is normal, what psychologists call an *adjustment reaction*. [A short guide on how to cope](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm).* [Normalcy bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy_bias) plays a factor. So does denial. You may hear things like ""it's just a flu, nothing to worry about."" It is [dangerously inaccurate](https://www.propublica.org/article/this-coronavirus-is-unlike-anything-in-our-lifetime-and-we-have-to-stop-comparing-it-to-the-flu) to compare COVID-19 to the flu. Facing the threat will help you prepare for it while denial puts you and your loved ones at risk. People in denial may take foolish risks like attend crowded events during an active outbreak, or fail to take precautionary measures, thereby accidentally passing the virus on to others. Denial also slows community response.* [Here is an excellent Harvard piece](https://nieman.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/pod-assets/microsites/NiemanGuideToCoveringPandemicFlu/CrisisCommunication/HowDoPeopleReactInAPandemic.aspx.html) on reactions and overreactions, denial versus panic, and the five principle bulwarks against denial. It is short and absolutely worth your time.* For officials, [crisis management teaches us](http://www.psandman.com/col/fear.htm) that it is important not to downplay a threat, otherwise you may lose the public's trust. Do not fear inducing a panic (see the aforementioned paper). The public needs you to be clear, informative, competent, and proactive. Studies such as [this one](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/208354) about the 1918 pandemic have shown just how effective a proactive approach can be on the part of leadership.

Touch elevator buttons with the tip of your key.* Ask your boss to work from home as many transmissions happen at work.* There is a global shortage of face masks. If you have extra, be prepared to donate some should the hospitals/care homes send a call out to the community.* If you have extra bottles of hand-sanitizer, please consider sharing them with those who do not have any. This is about working together, and minimizing community spread helps everyone within the community, including you and your loved ones.* Have 14 days of food in your home in case you are ordered under quarantine. There's nothing wrong with preparatory shopping in case of quarantine, but be careful not to do this once an outbreak has been declared in your city, as you may be lining up alongside sick people. At that point, it is better to shop at night/off hours, and after taking careful precautions. Or consider ordering your groceries online.* Don't share a cup. Don't share eating utensils.

I've asked the public and some medical professionals to weigh in, and have adjusted the document based on what they have said. I don't have an agenda or anything of that sort, and to reiterate, you are responsible for your own health and your own research. I'm just a volunteer who's put countless hours into this as I have a very particular communicative and collative skillset that I suspected could be of benefit in this ordeal—that and I've been following COVID-19 closely since mid-January. I hummed and hawed whether to even to start this document, yet after seeing how much it benefited people even in its crude early form, I decided to give it all of my focus.And now the beast is upon my doorstep, and I too have susceptible loved ones around me.The aim of this document was to inform, without minimizing risk. Accurate information reduces panic and anxiety, and helps people make the right decisions in a difficult time. I hope it succeeded in that regard, and that you found it useful. Yet there's always room for improvement, so feel free to constructively suggest changes (but if you're going to be a jerk about it, you will simply be blocked and ignored, and that's that). If you have a trustworthy more up-to-date source on an old metric of mine, please leave it in the comments. Also you are welcome to suggest alternative word/sentence choice changes. As I mentioned in the intro, this document went through many versions. Thank you to those from all around the world who had constructively weighed in to make it a more robust and useful PSA.

They are approving unemployment benefits for those who have already lost their jobs before the stay was in place. Where I work we initially had until Dec 4 to get vaccinated or ""quit""... now we don't have to. Most of the nurses and CNAs were about to ""quit"", and when we are already short staffed, that would have been a big problem.

""If human nature and history teach anything, it is that civil liberties face grave risks when governments proclaim indefinite states of emergency.""During a pandemic such as this one, it is even more important to safeguard the separation of powers set forth in our Constitution to avoid erosion of our liberties.""Doughty's ruling echoes one from U.S. District Judge Matthew Schelp, who issued a 32-page order on Monday blocking the Biden administration from enforcing their vaccine mandate on health care workers in 10 states.",1638619208.0

Once your personal choices start impacting the well-being of a population, there’s an issue. If anyone wants to choose to go unvaccinated, I’m perfectly okay with that in theory. In reality, their choice not to get vaccinated puts myself and others at risk, not just them. When talking about this, I think of the saying “Your right to swing your arm ends at my nose.” It’s simple, really. We should allow as many freedoms as possible so long as we don’t infringe on the rights of others. Using that logic, I don’t find mandatory* vaccines to be unjust in the slightest. If all the anti-vaxxers in the world wanted to form Anti-Vax island and live there in peace, I’d be perfectly cool with that, everyone knows what they’re signing up for. Unfortunately, they have to live in the real world with the rest of us, where most of us didn’t sign up for this shit. *How we define “mandatory” is relevant here. If by mandatory you mean required by the government or face arrest or fines, that’s a different topic (and a pretty far-fetched idea, imo.).

Hopefully, as you say, once the vaccine is cleared as a ""normal"" thing, it will become mandatory for anyone working with the public, and *especially* for anyone in healthcare.I was an Army brat, so I got literally dozens of vaccinations as a kid. New overseas posting, another needle in the arm. And my Dad was a career officer in the Medical Service Corps and was involved with mass immunization programs within the service more than once, so I grew up aware of all thus stuff.People of my generation also got the Salk vaccine, mostly at school. They didn't ask us, ""Who here has parents who don't believe in vaccination?"" They just said, ""Stick out your arm and don't cry."" Public health came first and there was no screwing around.

The fact that the general population doesn’t seem to fully appreciate that fact is incredibly frustrating.

Or are you so disconnected from reality that you haven’t seen over the last 30 years there hasn’t been a single Republican president actually strengthen the economy they’ve simply taken credit for the decisions of democrats while gutting things once they get in office seemingly to ensure a collapse once they leave. Gutting workers rights, unions, stagnating wages, corruption, stifling innovation by bailing out archaic industries, and destroying the environment that is the legacy of the Republican Party.It’s astounding you can say they don’t try to punish the poor when programs that alleviate the burdens of poverty simply don’t exist under republicans instead they seem to simply wish for the poor to suffer instead. Republicans oppose pushing to raise wages, yet want people to work for pennies at minimum wage jobs that wouldn’t allow for you to ever live out of poverty why also refusing to tax businesses that frankly are giving their employees starvation wages.What legislation have republicans actually tried? Like at all the entire mantra of the party has been we do nothing and we’re all out of ideas because government doesn’t work. My entire life I’ve never actually seen the Republican leadership do a single god damn thing other than right legislation to repeal or undue actual legislation written by democrats.

Reducing safety regulations and artificially pumping up dying fossil fuel industries is not making the economy stronger. Reducing regulations and corporate taxes is not making the economy stronger is a pump and dump that doesn't add anything beyond temporary value. If it wasn't for covid is not a valid argument because guess what we have covid it happened if he and the republican party took things seriously and didn't fuel conspiracy theories we would likely be past truly pushing towards herd immunity but we aren't because people wont get the vaccine. Literally nobody is truly incentivized not to work. That simply is not a reality of society but it is 100% foolish to think people are willing to work for jobs that simply do not pay enough for people to live. You cannot live comfortably in Louisiana on minimum wage and Louisiana is one of the lowest cost of living states in the entire country. Raising minimum wage does not realistically correlate to a 1:1 increase in cost of product which is plainly demonstrated even when looking at other countries with a higher minimum wage or other states. Hell Colorado has a 12.50 minimum wage and the cost of good are not 5$ higher. Also that is absolute 100% dog shit that minimum wage is meant for people in highschool. Companies aren't having trouble attracting high school workers they're struggling to attract people to work weekdays in the middle of the day for minimum wage you know when high schoolers are in school. Guns are the stupidest fucking argument to make theres no point to the argument. I like my guns but lets be real they don't add a single god damn thing to society and every time a reasonable restriction on guns is shot down it only makes an intense one more and more inevitable.

Tax cuts are not a long term solution to the problem.If you make more on unemployment that you do by being employed utilizing whatever skillset you have then the issue lies with employers not being willing to pay enough to attract talent.

3405,Louisiana,"Really low vaccination rate in La. Meanwhile, in Costa Rica, people cross a turbulent river to save vaccines from a flood.",goldfinchcat,"Good question. A good case study to look at are the invasive rabbits in Australia. In 1950 people released myxoma infected rabbits which was so deadly it took out millions of rabbits. However in a few years a new strain (series of mutations) produced a more milder condition. Less rabbits died because this new strain did not kill the host as quickly or as frequently. In this sense the virus appear to have become less lethal. But why? Because the original strain was so deadly it killed off it's host rabbit before the host rabbit could infect another host thus it killed it's lineage. The new strains with the new mutations did not kill off it's host too quickly before spreading to another host. On the other side, the rabbits that were able to live had slight differences in their DNA allowing them to survive the myxoma infection. In the 1990s the myxoma virus had mutated the ability to reduce the immune system. Thus allowing other bacteria or virus to kill the host. Kind of like HIV. Today Australia still has a rabbit problem because there are rabbits that are able to resist the new myxoma strain. This case is an example of host-parasite arm race. (You can read this paper for more info on rabbits and australia -- Next Step in the ongoing arms race between myxoma virus and wild rabbits in Australia is a novel disease phoenotype by Peter J. Kerr, Isabella M Cattadori ... eta...)\---So how does this relate to Covid-19 and the human race? We are like the rabbits getting sick. Thankfully Covid-19 wasn't 90% fatal. Since Covid-19 has a long period of time to spread to it's next host before killing off the host those strains my not change. The Covid-19 lineage continues, sometimes you get a slightly different covid-19 strain (delta for example) and sometimes the old strain continues. Both are spreading just fine. Both can still kill their host in 4 weeks because the strains haven't killed off their lineage before infecting a new host. How does putting off the vaccine cause new mutations that may become worst for humans?  Time, more hosts to infect and grow viral population. There is nothing stopping Covid-19 from doing what myxoma did in rabbits like gain the ability to reduce the host's immune system. For humans, it's a race between our technology and an ever changing virus. \-- I hope I was able to answer your question.",1627688410.0

If anything this year has proven that our students primarily need to learn how to be better students as a whole.   The only ones doing fine are the ones who know how to avoid procrastination, organize their tasks, and be self motivated.  Years of limiting homework definitely hasn't helped students work outside of the classroom as we.And with COVID safety measures, many of our usual procedures in the classroom can't be performed like normal this year regardless.  Or we have not taken any fee money to buy supplies this year...or every assignment has to work for both the in person and virtual students.  I am an electives teacher currently, so I'm saying this from experience.Tl;dr this year, no matter what we do, will not meet the expectations  or achieve the results of a normal school year.  One of my neighboring schools fully closed to deep clean from outrageous covid cases, another has 2/3rd of in person students currently quarantining.  Many of my co-workers are quarantining currently, not enough subs to cover classes, and I think some may be covid positive. ...I just don't know how bad it has to get before people are willing to make concessions.

4061,Louisiana,Louisiana's Solicitor General arguing against the vaccine mandate with the Supreme Court has tested positive for COVID-19,GandalfsAttorney,"Getting the vaccine drastically reduces your chances of having extreme symptoms and/or dying from covid. Everyone knows this by now. The vast majority of people who are dying are those who are unvaccinated, or who are vaccinated but still suffer from some kind of complicating factor (such as being elderly, having an auto-immune disease, etc.).  Ideally, if we have enough of the population vaccinated, it'll protect those who can't get vaccinated at all for health reasons from catching covid because there won't be enough host bodies for the virus to successfully replicate within and spread. There's also evidence that those who are vaccinated and still get covid have a lower viral load, are sick for a much shorter time period, and are therefore less likely to spread covid to others. I really wish people would stop acting like the vaccines don't matter ""because you can still catch covid if you're vaccinated!!!"" We all know vaccines significantly reduce your chance of dying from covid and reduce your chances of having severe illness. Hell the flu vaccine didn't stop me from getting the flu a few years ago, but being vaccinated made the illness a lot shorter and a LOT less severe than it was during years when I got the flu and wasn't vaccinated. The covid vaccine isn't foolproof, but it's definitely the best shot we have at getting this under control for good.

Because my research has been wanting.  “Vaccine efficacy studies on this new formulation of FluMist have not been completed, therefore it is unknown whether the vaccine offers any protection from influenza. The CDC voted against recommending FluMist over the available inactivated injectable influenza vaccines but stated it could be considered as an option, if appropriate.”“Since 2004, the seasonal influenza vaccine has failed to prevent influenza in vaccinated persons more than half the time, demonstrating a low of 10 percent effectiveness in 2004/2005 to a high of 60 percent effectiveness in 2010/2011. The average effectiveness of influenza vaccines over the past 14 flu seasons has been less than 41 percent.” If you have data, truth that is contradictory to this, some more recent information, please.  If not you, than somebody.  I want to know.  Because if it is true that the flu vaccine has turned a corner, I will protect my children at their next checkup.",1571422504.0

I think people equate being wrong with a change of mind. Nobody likes to be proven wrong about something they really believe. Adults in a family unit don't like to cause decisiveness within that unit. Kids get their attitude from parents. Public education doesn't have the same influence as parental sway. The cure?

It was the few teachers who failed spectacularly at their subject, were particularly ill suited, under equipped, and in some cases had their own agenda that spoiled education for myself and so many others. I attended a Catholic school, and many of the falsities and binary thinking that I was exposed to there are the same beliefs and attitudes I have found in people working in and around the New Orleans area. In Carl Sagan’s book, The Demon Haunted World, the opening chapters discuss how the European dark ages perpetuated superstition over the acquisition of knowledge and that the previous generation condemns the next to the same ignorance. I feel like there’s a lot truth to his conclusions. Society will never rid itself completely of these problems but they can and should be mitigated.

I have the degree to diagnose it and have come to the conclusion that it is, in fact, pure lunacy.In all seriousness, I do think there’s a certain amount of what basically comes down to a kind of group hysteria happening here, that’s a mix of political and ideological extremism, an almost Stockholm Syndrome level of identification with the people actually waging and profiting off of mass class warfare against them, and systemic failures in the education and social safety net programs that should be supporting progress. And it’s clearly not just public schools. Private schools may (or may not) be turning out better scientists, but they are failing utterly at the basic humanities.Every safety net program we devalue, diminishes our value of human life and that quality of life. Every public health mandate flaunted, every abortion outlawed, every person “othered” by the privileged class HAS to be devalued in some way in people’s minds, in order that they may convince themselves that “it can’t happen to me.” This is where the “Fair World Fallacy” comes in.

It's about how people are so adamant that they refuse to consider anything to decrease gun violence. For example, take seat belts. Congress, or whoever, noticed a lot of people dying in car accidents and decided to create a group to study the issue and try to find a solution. And they came up with seat belts, which did lessen car accident deaths. But, every time guns are even mentioned, some people start spouting all types of vitriol, lying about how the Democrats or liberals want to take their guns, and threatening to do all types of stuff to avoid even the most basic study to figure out how to make guns safer or lessen gun violence. And that's ridiculous and the people who do this are incredibly ignorant to me. Nobody is wanting to take guns away. Sure, there may be certain types of guns they decide to stop selling to the general public (and just sell to the military), but noone is wanting to do away with guns completely. Will a study help decrease gun violence. I don't know, but I'm willing for them to give it a go. Because I'm tired of the mass shootings that happen here, especially the school ones.

They want us to be educated. Not just in the Bible, but with worldly knowledge (although, they made sure to warn us that all knowledge in the world isn't always good advice, which is just a fact). In the Bible, God wants us to take care of ourselves so we can have the capacity to take care of others. My point is, the loud minority gives the silent majority a bad image. It's not a prevailing trend throughout Christians, but the more boisterous of us tend to be the ones to cause the biggest detrement to the reputations of other evangelical churches. There is hope for Christianity, but the minority makes my job a lot harder as an evangelical to talk about God, because the second I say the words ""I'm a non-denominational/evangelical Christian"", people are already judging who I am based on what ""the majority of the Christian community"" are. The ones of us who are really into God's word, the ones of us who care for others and who want to make the world a better place, deny the teachings of big church. Deny the teachings of churches out of touch with scripture.

Your neighbor being fat as fuck won't make you fat as fuck.  You could get Covid and be fine, however the delta variant of Covid is highly contagious.  On average for the delta variant an infected individual will go on to infect 7 other people (for comparison the flu is 2 on average, while chicken pox is 10 and measles is around 18).  So essentially after just 3 rounds (6-8 weeks time) of spreading YOU will have been responsible for getting on average 343 other people infected.  With a death rate now around 1.5%, 5 people could be dead in the next two months because you didn't want to get a vaccine.The chance of you dying from just getting the vaccine is about 0.  The chance of Covid killing you after you've been fully vaccinated (2 weeks after 2nd shot) also drops from 1.5% to almost 0.This is just DYING.  If you don't die you still have a good (5% or higher) chance of needing to be hospitalized for 1-2 weeks.  Even if you have insurance, that's still going to be a costly bill, lost work/wages, etc...   Getting the vaccine lowers your chances of needing hospitalization by well over 100.  Think of the vaccine as not only giving your immune system a bunch of guns to fight off invaders, but also telling your immune system who the enemy is, so they can start shooting ASAP.   You might still get invaded, but it's much better for your immune system to be prepared for an attack, than to be caught off guard.   Do you have an alarm system for your house/car? Do you have a gun/weapon for your safety?   YOU can give your immune system both a gun and alarm system against Covid for FREE.

5039,Louisiana,So how many how young have to die Louisiana?,Ao_Andon,"The vaccines have all shown a profound and distinct ability to lessen one's chances of contracting the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which in turn makes one less likely to spread the virus to others, particularly if they themselves have been inoculated. While side effects do exist, the are generally mild or treatable. Alas, no vaccine is 100% effective, and so masks and other PPE (which are, generally, also not 100% effective on their own) are recommended in conjuction with the vaccines in order to help bolster one's overal degree of protection. While it *is* still possi le to contract the virus, despite precautions, studies have shown that such cases are typically shorter and less likely to result in death or morbidities, such as decreased respiratory function. To top it all off, the virus is evolving as it spreads, with multiple variations already found; not all of these, or future variants will be affected by the vaccines currently in production, necessitating whole new rounds of research, development, and testing for a disease that, by all accounts, could have been under control by now.These precautions are needed to prevent unnecessary suffering, both in oneself and others. Many people, like young children and the immunocompromised, are unable to receive the vaccine, and it is our duty as Americans and generally-decent-human-beings to protect them. Many hospitals are unable to admit new patients due to the influx caused by Covid19, or else crowd their patients together, spreading the virus along with other illnesses. Hurricane Ida also plays a role in this; having destroyed so many hospitals, the previously mentioned lack of hospital space is only being exacerbated.In short, get the vaccine to protect yourself, those you might infect, and those *they* might infect. The virus is potentially life-threatening, spreading, and constantly evolving, and due to the fact that diseases tend to spread in an exponential manner, your decision to vaccinate could help to protect untold numbers of people and relieve a medical system that's been strained to its breaking point.",1633185078.0

5122,Louisiana,"After debate, LSU board asks Louisiana to require COVID vaccine for public school students",WizardMama,"Article:The LSU Board of Supervisors narrowly approved a resolution Friday asking the Louisiana Department of Health to add the COVID vaccines to the list of shots required before students can attend public schools, colleges, and universities.Supervisor Jay Blossman, of Mandeville, said he was uncomfortable with the university sending a message to the state that could lead to making students get vaccinated for COVID.“It gives me heartburn,” Blossman said, adding it should be a personal choice. “If you’re worried about the COVID, get the shot.”The Board’s resolution acknowledges the concerns raised by faculty and students, requests the health department to consider adding the COVID vaccines to the required list, and encourages voluntary vaccinations on LSU campuses.The Board’s Academic and Research Committee voted 4-3 to advance the resolution after much, and often, heated discussion. Then at the end of the hearing, the full board summarily approved all other matters advanced by committees during the Board’s meeting in Alexandria – except for the resolution. The board discussed the matter further, added language that LSU would also inform students of their legal rights to opt out of any vaccination, then approved the resolution on a 9-2 vote, with several supervisors not voting.Usually matters before the 16-member board that sets policies for the LSU colleges and universities are handled with unanimous consent and little conversation. The board, for instance, accepted the contract for incoming LSU president, William F. Tate IV, and outgoing LSU Health Shreveport Chancellor Dr. Ghali E. Ghali in a matter of minutes without much comment.State law already requires students to have been vaccinated against a lot of maladies such as polio, smallpox and diphtheria, before being allowed to attend. They can opt out for religious and medical reasons.But the COVID vaccines were only approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on an emergency basis and can’t unilaterally be added to the required list until fully approved, General Counsel Winston DeCuir told the board.In addition to state law, DeCuir pointed out that House Bill 498, which passed the Legislature and is sitting on the governor’s desk, prohibits discrimination against those seeking state services based on COVID vaccination status, and House Resolution 20 requires schools to inform parents and students that they can opt out of getting vaccinated for COVID.“So right now, the landscape is that there are laws to allow public schools to mandate vaccination but that requires approval by the Louisiana Department of Health,” he said.Attorney General Jeff Landry recently said he would likely sue the Board if the COVID vaccination were made mandatory at LSU.Faculty and student groups passed resolutions asking LSU leadership to require COVID vaccinations, as have been required as a condition of enrollment at many private schools around the country. Some states have allowed their public universities to require the shots, including Michigan, New Jersey, Massachusetts, California, Rhode Island, and Virginia, but none of the Deep South states have.LSU President Tom Galligan said 73% of LSU’s faculty have been vaccinated and 56% of the staff have. But only 26% of the students have received the shot.The LSU Board also formally accepted the employment contract of William Tate IV as LSU’s new president with applause and little discussion beyond outgoing President Tom Galligan saying, “Yay.’Tate’s five-year contract begins July 6. He’ll be paid $725,000 per year base salary, plus receive an annual $35,000 housing allowance, and a $15,000 per year vehicle allowance.With much less levity, the Board then approved Dr. Ghali E. Ghali stepping down as chancellor of the LSU medical school, returning to the faculty and being paid the remainder of his contract. His contract expires in December.",1624110679.0

What's more, is that of those 346, only 4 were sick severely enough to require hospitalization, and **none** of them died. So please explain to me how the vaccines do not prevent infection, illness, or (especially) death, when one of the biggest antivax arguments has been ""why vaccinate when it only kills 1-2% of the infected,"" considering that at that rate, we should have seen 3-7 deaths. The only thing concerning to me at this point is that the infected vaccinated people *did unfortunately* show a viral load similar to that of unvaccinated infected,  which would suggest that transmission is still very much a possibility. Even then, though, between masks, vaccines, and the fact that vaccinated people have a much better prognosis when they *do* get infected, I have a feeling that most new infections will, unsurprisingly, be affecting the unvaccinated.

5245,Louisiana,Summary of Today's Press Conference by Gov. Edwards,WizardMama,"# Moving into Phase 2 on Friday, June 5th.**SUMMARY**^(\*Note everything is written down live and to keep up must sometimes be paraphrased by me.)*Gov. Edwards** 1 st day of hurricane season Invest-93L 90% chance of development* Ranked 10th at State with highest coronavirus cases per capita, we used to be number 2.. so good job!!!* Today is the lowest amount of deaths reported since March 22nd.* The lowest amount of hospitalized patients since March 25th.* Louisiana did exceed the testing goal for May and exceeded 200,00 tests for the month well in excess of 4.3% of the population. In May we doubled the tests we did in April. The CDC goal is 2% and we are more than twice that!* We are getting close to a 10% total case positivity rate.* Louisiana is seeing signs of progress and heading in the right direction, but there is still a lot of COVID-19 in the state. It is in every community. We are ramping up testing and contact tracing.* Not every region of the state is doing well.*The great Doctor Billioux** The state is seeing a decreasing amount of peoples showing up to emergency departments with COVID or flu-like symptoms.* Cases are continuing to decrease.* Hospitalizations are continually decreasing.* This progress IS NOT EVEN ACROSS THE STATE.   * Region 6 is increasing in cases and hospitalizations (Rapides) with congregate setting spread AND community spread.   * Region 1,5, and 9 are in Plateauing in cases.* Always looking at percent positivity rates.   * Yes even as we are finding more cases, as a portion of cases to total tests (case positivity rate) that is still coming down.* While the state is seeing a reduced amount of hospitalizations in the state. Region 8 is seeing an increase as well as Region 6.* 613 contact tracers have been hired and 303 have completed their training.   * 219 cases/contacts have been referred to resource coordinators.* Upon a positive result, we are trying to reach out to possible contacts within 24 hours and possibly infected people out of the public.* If you are exposed you will receive a phone call from \[NUMBER TO BE ADDED LATER\].* Data is promising so it is reasonable to move into Phase 2 as these trends move forward.* **Largest difference(s) between Phase 1 & 2:**   * Up to 50% occupancy with parties maintaining 6ft of distance in previously approved open businesses.   * Bars and breweries without LDH food permits can open at 25% occupancy seated.   * Day spa, tattoo-shops, massage shops, and estheticians can open.   * Swimming pools (controlled recreational swimming) can open.   * Bowling, skating, and event centers can open.   * Individuals who are 65+, cardiac disease, diabetes, lung disease, obesity, or immune disorders are still in Phase 0 and stat home if at all possible. There is still a lot of COVID-19 in our communities. Even if you are not in a high-risk group you need to evaluate if you live with someone high-risk or around someone who is high-risk.* **YOU STILL NEED TO WEAR A MASK** wearing a mask may last up to 3 years! The main mode of transmission is by particles that leave our mouths by speaking, singing, yelling, sneezing, coughing, etc.   * If you see no one is wearing masks and are not following guidance do your job as a consumer and do not patronize that business. Do not put your life at risk for something like a bowling game.* Continue to stay at home when you are sick, wash your hands often for 20 seconds at a time, and practice social distancing (stay 6ft away) from people who are not part of your household.*Why were assisted living facilities not included in the nursing home statistics?*When we think of congregate settings we worry about the spread in that setting. We know there are high levels of asymptomatic carriers. That presents a real risk where you live in close contact and cannot keep yourself separate.Nursing homes present a unique risk for bad outcomes for people who live there because they are more likely to be 65+ and/or have the high-risk comorbidities.*What about visiting nursing homes*?They have the highest risk, we do not know what late summer early fall will bring with new treatments, plenty of PPE, or possible vaccines. You need to balance the risk of COVID spread with the risk of loneliness. For the elderly the risk of loneliness can be deadly.*Rationality on restrictions on bars why are they restricted more than restaurants?*It is an evolving epidemic and we learn more after time. Bars are a very high risk for facilitating a high spread of COVID-19. We have seen in other locations that bars have had to be shut down due to the bars causing too many outbreaks. We would rather open in a slow steady safe manner than have to snap back restrictions. For bars, the customers will have to be seated to served and seated 6ft apart. We hope that we will be able to reduce the high risk that bars present for transmitting COVID-19.*Gov. Edwards** Children's museums are not closed in Phase 2 but have certain restrictions they must follow like closing down every set period to cleanse and disinfect. Certain tactile exhibits may be limited.* **Phase 2 will last 21 days and will expire on June 26th.*** Everyone needs to take personal responsibility and people should not patronize establishments that do not follow guidelines.* The greatest risk of the virus is with airborne transmission.   * With more businesses open and more customers go back in contact will increase so it more important than ever that people wear masks when not dealing with people in their household.* LDH has a ""thank you for wearing a mask"" signs for businesses to print and display. More specific guidelines will be provided at [opensafely.la.gov](https://opensafely.la.gov/)**In regards to the protest*** Our protests have been peaceful.* Thanks Faith Leaders who have been in good communication with the state and the public at large.* Thanks everyone for keeping the focus on issues of concern. Obviously what was captured on video that happened to George Floyd was egregious and far below what is acceptable. No member of society or law enforcement will agree that those actions were acceptable.* We had similar issues in 2016 but have reformed our criminal justice system and how law enforcement is trained and interacts with the public. We continue to try and grow.* Will continue to work with local and state agencies to monitor and keep in front of developments.*Questions*Do you agree with the President and believe all Governors are weak?I am not going to engage in that. I was in the call. I believe the President was addressing other leaders.*Is it time to revisit some of the state's policies with the criminal justice system?*I suspect this could be better addressed to a law enforcement official. I do not believe any training promotes the type of actions that the officer displayed. It is a gross departure with what is part of the police training. We need to do a better job with hiring, training, and monitoring over-time to ensure that officers should still be employed.*Opening schools*We will know more as we receive additional guidance from the CDC.*Sleepaway & summer camps*Sleepaway camps will not be allowed. Summer camps have been allowed since Phase 1 with 1 adult and no more than 9 children in a camping group. Will change to 1 adult per 24 children.*People wrote a letter in opposition to not these guidelines*We are following all White House and CDC guidelines.*What about the* *W.H.O. initial advice against wearing masks*The CDC of. the United States and the Office of Public Health in Louisiana all agree on the use of masks. As we find out more about the airborne transmission of this virus coupled with the asymptomatic carriers it just makes sense. Guidance has been clear and consistent for many weeks now. Everything we have learned has made it more important not less.\------*Courtesy of*  r/Coronaviruslouisiana",1591044504.0

5249,Louisiana,Summary of Today's Press Conference by Gov. Edwards,Blucrunch,"> If you see no one is wearing masks and are not following guidance do your job as a consumer and do not patronize that business. Do not put your life at risk for something like a bowling game.This is actually a tough one. The thing is, larger organizations, from what I can tell, are more likely to be following all the guidelines well (with exceptions!) than local, smaller organizations. Why this is I can only speculate, but I'd venture to guess that having a larger amount of resources means they're more informed and prepared and have the infrastructure and personnel to implement the guidelines.We don't, however, want to stop patronizing local places in favor of large organizations. So, what do?The best thing an overachiever could do is if you patronize a local business that you like, and then notice wearing masks not being enforced, or worse, openly flouting those guidelines, call up that business and speak to a manager. Ask what guidelines they are following. Explain that you think they are important guidelines to follow. Explain also that if they won't consider following these guidelines more closely that you will be going to their direct competition (find out what that is and name drop, for more impact). If they refuse or you witness no change, stop going there and follow through with your threat.That's a lot, I know.

5251,Louisiana,Summary of Today's Press Conference with Gov. Edwards (6/3),WizardMama,"## Summary^(\*Information is typed live and may be paraphrased.)**Storm Incoming 2020 - Gov. Edwards*** TS Cristobal is headed for Louisiana.* We will receive rain before the storm so the ground will be saturated. This will be a severe weather event for Louisiana.* New Orleans and Baton Rouge currently slated to be on the East side of the storm. 10-15"" in 24 hours *after* several days of saturation from storms. Further west would be 8-10"" of rain.* Good news river levels are lower than last year when we had the hurricane, so there is more capacity for them to take in more water. There is no current threat to levee overtopping on the Mississippi River.**COVID-19 - Gov. Edwards*** Today has the lowest number of hospitalized patients since March 22nd.* 10.2% for all tests administered we want to get below 10%. We used to see 30-40%, but it hasn't been above 10% for 3 weeks and has been averaging closer to 5% lately.* With everything going on it is easy to feel overwhelmed. Louisiana has set up [conquercovid19.la](https://conquercovid19.la/) is a comprehensive website with resources and types to stay calm and reduce stress. For children, families, adults, and first responders. You can call 1-866-310-7977.**Billy ? of Tourism Board*** All welcome centers will be opened on Friday. Lobbies will be limited to 10 people at a time. Facilities will be cleaned multiple times per day and the staff will be wearing masks. Louisiana ""Feed Your Soul"" masks will be given out to all visitors.* Extending state park promotions (if you book 3 nights you get the 4th night free) with the code: WELCOME BACK* Louisiana's over the past several weeks have supported museums and state parks. The last two weekends saw over 10,000 visitors to the state parks. That hasn't happened since 2008. Everything was done with safety in mind.* Asking Louisiana to support Louisiana! Take a staycation or road trip around our great state!* Offering Louisiana seafood prepared by a Louisiana Chef and Louisiana musicians to conferences.* Just landed a national trucking conference to St Charles that was going to go to Miami.**Questions:***In terms of conventions and conferences, what are the requirements for them?*Most conferences are slated for the end of the year or next year. The trucking conference is next year. Many of the smaller conferences are for the end of the year when we are hopeful we will be through the 3 phases and back to normal.*Which state park had the largest turn out recently*?Grand Isle. Louisiana had a great response to that special and booked every cabin and location available.*Will there be an effect on the budget?*Yes, absolutely but RV sales are up significantly and we are pushing people to travel to state parks and eat in the local communities. We see this as a trend for next year and will take advantage of it.*Are there other conventions that are looking to leave Louisiana?*Yes, we are currently working with 9 other conferences, but do not want to release the name. The trucking company polled its members and with the Louisiana seafood and entertainment, they wanted to come to us. We will do everything to have our calendar full for next year.*With everything going on can Louisiana handle everything going on?*Yes, we can because we are tough people. There is not a hurricane in the Gulf and there are no forecasts staying it will be a hurricane at landfall, although it could theoretically pick up speed and be a Cat 1 at landfall. I have asked local religious leaders to pray for us. \[List of all issues Louisiana is facing\], you just start adding it all together and then you get to the illegal killing of George Floyd... \[thanks people of Louisiana for peaceful protests\]. You do have all of that going on and now you have the Tropical Storm Cristobal and the heavy incoming rains but the people of Louisana are very tough resilient people, its not that I don't worry, I do. I'm just always amazed at how hard-working, good, and faithful our people are. We are working with every region, and aid available to the state. We've been working with FEMA since the start of the public health event to prepare for storm season with the pandemic.*Is there a chance of an evacuation being ordered?*Right now I am not announcing an evacuation. The national weather service told us today that Saturday night is the earliest it will hit but will most likely be Sunday. What we know is that it will dump a lot of rain and has the possibility of stalling. We are encouraging everyone to take this very seriously and be as ready as you can be for it. We know the rivers are a few feet lower than what they were when the Hurricane hit last year. We know they have more capacity for rainfall.*In terms of sheltering if that is needed what plans have been made in light of COVID-19?*We have plans that involve mega shelters as an option and have prepositioned tents so people can have a semi-self contained area. Congregant shelters are not optimal. Many weeks ago we began working on getting early approval for sheltering in hotels or motels rooms. Another challenge we have is the Red Cross volunteers will not be available to us as they normally are because they are in the vulnerable age group. Historically we have had reciprocal agreements with sister states where if we need to evacuate a large portion of our population other states will take us in. This is complicated by the national health emergency, and we are trying to work it.As for this weekend, we are not announcing any evacuations or shelters but will announce them if it becomes necessary.*Monday you mentioned you were working with the Federal Gov on the protests? What type of information are they providing?*The information we have been getting has been very generic in nature. Things they are seeing in other states and what we should prepare for.In regards to t*ourism is there any fear that it may be hard to persuade people to come back here as opposed to other states that weren't hit as hard as COVID-19.*Due to Louisiana's uniqueness in America, we will get back to where were before COVID-19. We are not sure when that will be, but you can remember in the immediate aftermath of Katrina people were saying New Orleans and Louisiana will never come back. Our people are much more resilient than that and our state is so unique. This will be predicated on things we cannot control like when the vaccine will be released and when the virus will be less of a menace.*Does the state plan to extend eviction deadlines?*We are working on that. We suspended evictions but not the requirement to pay rent. We encourage all individuals to work with their landlords to come up with a payment plan to catch up on missed rental payments. We are working with various organizations to see if there is funding available for a rental assistance program. I do have a formal announcement for this moment but it is something we are looking at. CARES Act money is largely spoken for. We are looking at legislation moving through Congress to see if those funds could be used.^((This was post has originally appeared LIVE on) r/Coronaviruslouisiana^(.))",1591215144.0

However, to appreciate the full scope of the challenge ahead, you are encouraged to carefully read this entire document, which will be updated regularly as long as it stays on the front page of your sub.The aim of this document is simple: it's best to walk into something knowing what you're about to face. It also aims to reduce anxiety, panic, and misinformation by arming you with key sourced information, all without downplaying the risks of COVID-19.The document has gone through hundreds of iterations thanks to global community feedback, including from places such as Seattle, LA, Australia, and Canada. Although all facts are meticulously sourced from experts in their fields, you are responsible for your own health and your own research. Further, contextualization of information remains an ongoing challenge, as does keeping up with a fluid situation. Final word will always belong to the health authorities, as well as the mods of this subreddit.Now brace yourself, because this is going to suck a little bit.#**CONTEXT:**A recent in-depth [study](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2002/2002.03268.pdf) has shown just how incredibly infectious COVID-19 is. Unfortunately, its spread [has not slowed](https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fe4uza/how_would_you_visualize_the_evolution_of/), and the virus has only been halted through stringent physical distancing measures.In other words, and as the Director of the WHO himself has [said](https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1235635005415739393), this is not a drill.**The bad news:** There are currently over [300,000](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) global confirmed cases of COVID-19, and the WHO recently [classified it](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1237777021742338049) as a pandemic. Now it seems that it has arrived upon your doorstep, which means there is likely exponential and silent human-to-human transmission in the community.**The good news:** knowledge is a weapon that defeats these things. It worked in 1918 against the Spanish Flu, when we essentially stopped the medieval practice of blood-letting (you know when they drained you of blood because they thought that would cure whatever ailed you? Or leeching?). And it worked against many other outbreaks since: Smallpox, MERS, SARS, Ebola, etc. The WHO's tackling of Smallpox alone was nothing short of scientific heroism.And so, a hundred years after 1918, here we are again, facing perhaps the [greatest test of our generation](https://twitter.com/Channel4News/status/1235994748005085186).The problem is that these days we're inundated with so much information that, when a real threat comes along, it's buried under a mountain of clutter. And although this document is not all-encompasing by any means, hopefully it will help you see through some of that clutter, as well as give those new to the threat an opportunity to hit the ground running.So go ahead and meet [your foe](https://i.imgur.com/okCsxd1.jpg). Do not underestimate it. Now prepare to go to war.#**IMPORTANT:*** **The main mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets: coughing, sneezing, and breathing.** But you can also get it through shaking hands, kissing somebody who is sick, or touching a contaminated surface (droplet dispersion; think of a cough plume settling). This can include handrails, doorknobs, elevator buttons, and surfaces prone to a droplet dispersion cloud. ""Cough dispersion"" basically means anytime a sick person coughs, they're dispering a plume of droplets over a given area. The viral particles within those droplets then settle on ordinary surfaces. People touch those surfaces then touch their phones or their faces, which in turn lead to contact with their eyes, mouth, or nose, inducing infection. Therefore it is best to keep a 6 ft ""coughing distance"" from people, and treat everything you touch in public as if it's been contaminated (see the ""Risk Reduction"" section below). **[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bI5pQGXl2o&feature=youtu.be) an excellent short video on the topic.** Read a little more on the subject [here](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek).* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW, BUT IS GAINING [ACCEPTANCE](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/health/coronavirus-how-it-spreads.html?0p19G=2870) IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY]** There now appears to be evidence the virus can spread through breathing. Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota: **""The findings [of the study] confirm that COVID-19 is spread simply through breathing, even without coughing. Don't forget about hand washing, but at the same time we've got to get people to understand that if you don't want to get infected, you can't be in crowds. Social distancing is the most effective tool we have right now.""** [Source.](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/03/study-highlights-ease-spread-covid-19-viruses) (Crucial to understand: the research specifies patients who are symptomatic, and makes no claims about asymptomatic transfer.) **UPDATE:** [Dr. Osterholm just went on the Joe Rogan show to explain the situation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3URhJx0NSw).

This is corroborated by Dr. Norman Swan on March 14th, via ABC Australia, who says ""you *are* infectious *before* the symptoms come out, there's no question about that.""

[Excellent short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOJqHPfG7pA&feature=youtu.be) on the topic.* Here's a breakdown of the above: Approximately 80% of laboratory confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, which includes non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases. 13.8% have had severe disease requiring hospitalization, and 6.1% were critical, requiring the ICU (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure). (These numbers are as of Feb 20, 2020, based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases in China, from the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf).) **Update:** European Society of Intensive Care Medicine is reporting a 10% ICU rate, and has [issued a word of warning](https://twitter.com/marcelsalathe/status/1235662457261023232).* Due to the highly infectious nature of COVID-19, **the danger is not just the mortality rate for the vulnerable, but the possibility of overwhelming the health infrastructure, which in turn causes unnecessary fatalities.** * As it stands, it wouldn't take much to overwhelm hospitals, hence why it's important to start taking preventative measures now (outlined in the Risk Reduction section below)—especially because hospitals are already burdened with a heavy flu season (in the Northern hemisphere, that is). For example, if only 10 out of every 1000 people required a bed, we'd already be coming up short, as in the USA there are only [2.77](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds for every 1000 people, and [2.58](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) in Canada.

Do not underestimate this virus.#**PSYCHOLOGY:*** Do not panic, but give yourself permission to feel fear. [Fear gets you prepared](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm). As for panic, all one has to do is look at the crowded halls of Wuhan hospitals during the early phases of the outbreak to understand how panic worsens problems. A jolt of fear is all right, as it gets you moving in the right direction. After that point, however, you must turn to thinking clearly, level-headedly, and listen to your local health authorities. As for what you can do, follow the steps in the ""Risk Reduction"" section below.* Ignoring this threat will only make it worse, as it preys on your underestimation of it. That underestimation may cost you your life, or the life of a loved one.* Upon first learning about the extent of the threat, you may become anxious and hyper aware and start taking extra pecautions. This is normal, what psychologists call an *adjustment reaction*. [A short guide on how to cope](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm).* [Normalcy bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy_bias) plays a factor. So does denial. You may hear things like ""it's just a flu, nothing to worry about."" It is [dangerously inaccurate](https://www.propublica.org/article/this-coronavirus-is-unlike-anything-in-our-lifetime-and-we-have-to-stop-comparing-it-to-the-flu) to compare COVID-19 to the flu. Facing the threat will help you prepare for it while denial puts you and your loved ones at risk. People in denial may take foolish risks like attend crowded events during an active outbreak, or fail to take precautionary measures, thereby accidentally passing the virus on to others. Denial also slows community response.* [Here is an excellent Harvard piece](https://nieman.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/pod-assets/microsites/NiemanGuideToCoveringPandemicFlu/CrisisCommunication/HowDoPeopleReactInAPandemic.aspx.html) on reactions and overreactions, denial versus panic, and the five principle bulwarks against denial. It is short and absolutely worth your time.* For officials, [crisis management teaches us](http://www.psandman.com/col/fear.htm) that it is important not to downplay a threat, otherwise you may lose the public's trust. Do not fear inducing a panic (see the aforementioned paper). The public needs you to be clear, informative, competent, and proactive. Studies such as [this one](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/208354) about the 1918 pandemic have shown just how effective a proactive approach can be on the part of leadership. But [look what can happen](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/philadelphia-threw-wwi-parade-gave-thousands-onlookers-flu-180970372/) on the other end of the spectrum.

Also disinfect reusable shopping bags, wallets, keys.* Take initiative and disinfect doorknobs and elevator buttons in your building. Do not wait for management to do it for you.* Keep disinfectant by every entrance to your house. * Avoid anyone who is coughing, and [stay away from poorly ventilated places](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200302_34/). * Stay away from crowds. * Cough into your elbow, or preferably into a tissue that is disposed of into the trash.* While in public, only touch things with your knuckle, a glove, or your sleeve. Touch elevator buttons with the tip of your key.* Ask your boss to work from home as many transmissions happen at work.* There is a global shortage of face masks. If you have extra, be prepared to donate some should the hospitals/care homes send a call out to the community.* If you have extra bottles of hand-sanitizer, please consider sharing them with those who do not have any. This is about working together, and minimizing community spread helps everyone within the community, including you and your loved ones.* Have 14 days of food in your home in case you are ordered under quarantine. There's nothing wrong with preparatory shopping in case of quarantine, but be careful not to do this once an outbreak has been declared in your city, as you may be lining up alongside sick people. At that point, it is better to shop at night/off hours, and after taking careful precautions. Or consider ordering your groceries online.* Don't share a cup. Don't share eating utensils. Don't share a toothbrush. In fact, don't share anything that comes in direct contact with your mouth or nose.* Keep air circulating.

I've asked the public and some medical professionals to weigh in, and have adjusted the document based on what they have said. I don't have an agenda or anything of that sort, and to reiterate, you are responsible for your own health and your own research. I'm just a volunteer who's put countless hours into this as I have a very particular communicative and collative skillset that I suspected could be of benefit in this ordeal—that and I've been following COVID-19 closely since mid-January. I hummed and hawed whether to even to start this document, yet after seeing how much it benefited people even in its crude early form, I decided to give it all of my focus.And now the beast is upon my doorstep, and I too have susceptible loved ones around me.The aim of this document was to inform, without minimizing risk. Accurate information reduces panic and anxiety, and helps people make the right decisions in a difficult time. I hope it succeeded in that regard, and that you found it useful. Yet there's always room for improvement, so feel free to constructively suggest changes (but if you're going to be a jerk about it, you will simply be blocked and ignored, and that's that). If you have a trustworthy more up-to-date source on an old metric of mine, please leave it in the comments. Also you are welcome to suggest alternative word/sentence choice changes. As I mentioned in the intro, this document went through many versions. Thank you to those from all around the world who had constructively weighed in to make it a more robust and useful PSA. Other communities are invited to post a link to the source doc in the [Canada sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/fghd23/psa_regarding_covid19_a_warning/), which will be kept up to date (as will any PSA I posted myself, as long as it's still on the main page of your sub).My very best wishes from Victoria, BC, Canada, and good luck to us all.P.S.

This is the result of failures from both parties. The fed balance sheet shows a huge amount of borrowing during the great recession, followed by additional borrowing in 2014/2015 (why???). During this period (2009-2017), we never paid back any of the debt we accrued. Under normal circumstances, the feds would decrease the balance sheet and raise interest rates as we recover from a recession, however, the recovery from 2008-09 recession was so poor, our economy couldn't handle that. When Trump took over, we began to let these bonds mature and roll of the balance sheet (2019ish). Interest rates were finally on the rise again with low inflation. All signs of a great economy. Things were looking up, and then covid hit. We borrowed out of our ass again and the fed's dropped rates again. We're backed into a corner today and there's no escaping the gigantic financial reset that's about to happen. I was shocked when we passed the infrastructure bill given the current state of our economy.

Republican policies. Simple. You can see the track record of disaster economies since Reagan took office. You tell us wake up, but you seem asleep yourself. Reagan's trickle down economics caused a housing bubble and the rise of income inequality. Bush is the reason we started getting into trillions in dollars of debt because of his failed policies and a false war. Which caused an economic crash. Then don't get me started on the failure that is Trump. You wanna know what damages our economy? Not the borrowing, it's the stupid fucking spending that administration's have done for the past 50 years.
